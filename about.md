We are the  Pittsburgh Chapter of the Delta Chi Fraternity. Founded in 2003 and chartered in 2005, we were founded on 4 core principles:

1.  Academics always come first
2.  Friends are always welcome
3.  Chivalry is not dead
4.  Absolutely NO hazing
	
Our founding fathers started a tradition of excellence, and we have tried to not only meet these expectations, but further them over the years. I encourage you to explore this
site to learn about our past, our current members, and what we are currently up to around campus!

ok bye,

WEBMASTER ;)
