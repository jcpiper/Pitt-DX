Insert heartwearming message about how we raise lots of money for the V Foundation and the Children's Miracle Network.

Also discuss how we do it. e.g. Canning, Fall Carnival/V week, and some other stuff I'm probably forgetting.

We have pledged $6000 to the V Foundation over a two year period (ending this summer) and a one year pledge to raise $5000 for CMN.

:)
