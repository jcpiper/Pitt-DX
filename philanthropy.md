Every semester we raise money for two worthy causes: [The V Foundation](http://www.jimmyv.org/) and [Children's Miracle Network](https://giveamiracle.childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/).

## V Foundation ##
The V Foundation is Delta Chi's official philanthropic organization. All undergraduate and alumnus members of The Delta Chi Fraternity have joined hands in fighting cancer together. 
Each year, Delta Chi chapters and colonies raise tens of thousands of dollars for international and local charitable organizations. It is the hope of Delta Chi that if all chapters unite 
their services and resources to benefit a single organization, Delta Chi can make a greater impact on that organization.

## Children's Miracle Network ##
Children's Miracle Network is the official philanthropic organization of the University of Pittsburgh's Greek System. CMN is an international non-profit organization 
that raises money to support children's hospitals and medical research.

We have pledged $6000 to the V Foundation over a two year period (ending this summer) and a one year pledge to raise $5000 for CMN.
