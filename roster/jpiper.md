Justin is our current webmaster, and a self proclaimed shit-head. He currently lives in a closet (literally, unfortunately), and can't wait to "Get the hell out of there" this
summer. He is believed to live in the library, yet has somehow managed to convince others he maintains a healthy social life. 

Here's a picture of the goober: [Justin](http://127.0.0.1:4000/images/doc.jpg)
