			<p class="tabc">In August of 2014, the Chapter moved to a University-owned Fraternity House on the hill. Over the course of this academic year, we have been 
			working tirelessly to make it our own, painting, decorating and building. As we continue to build and improve, we have a number of projects that are 
			in progress, or are in need of funding. Payments can be made through PayPal, or mailed to House Manager Eric Baumann at 3800 University Dr. C. Frat 
			House 1 â€“ Delta Chi. Pittsburgh, PA. 15213. All checks should be made out to University of Pittsburgh Delta Chi.</p>

			<div class="tabc"><h3>Room Sponsorships</h3> For $500 a room can be sponsored for 2 years. Rooms in the house are equipped with heat, but no air 
			conditioning, so $300 of the fee will go towards purchasing an air conditioner for each room, which can be connected to the windows. The other $200 
			will go to the general House Improvement budget line, which finances repairs and other house projects. Each sponsor can choose which room in the house they would like 
			to sponsor, and have a plaque with the name of their choice above the door. There are 14 occupied rooms in the house, sponsorships are first-come, 
			first-serve.

			<div class="tabc"><h3>New Rush Banner</h3> As the Pitt Inter Fraternity Council has approved deferred recruitment, the importance of expanding the chapterâ€™s 
			PR to individuals that are new to campus is vital. The old rush banner is small, creased, and not eye-catching. To stand out among the various banners in 
			the crowd, the chapter has come together to design a new, larger, more engaging banner (3â€™x6â€™) to display prominently in the Quad during recruitment.

			<div class="tabc"><h3>Rolling Whiteboard</h3> As the house has become the center of the chapter, it has also become a common area for brothers and associate 
			members to study. One resource that brothers find especially helpful are rolling whiteboards to improve studying in group settings and visually. In addition, 
			the whiteboard can also be very useful to making presentations to large groups, especially at recruitment events.

			<div class="tabc"><h3>Stage</h3> For fundraising events such as Karaoke Night, as well as social events, the stage provides a safe and mobile raised 
			surface for presentations and other events.

			<div class="tabc"><h3>Projector</h3> To aid with presentations as well as painting projects, a high-quality projector is vital to making presentations to potential
			new members and ensure high-quality painting in the house

			<div class="tabc"><h3>Speaker System</h3> As the years have worn on, the fraternityâ€™s speaker system have withstood a significant amount of wear-and-tear. Upgrading 
			the amplifier and mixer, as well as purchasing or designing a cabinet to store and protect the equipment would provide a boost to the quality of a variety of events. 
			Also, cabinets would give a more polished, organized appearance.
